This is the read me file to run the code 
This is an Angular project, so to run this code, you should first install npm. The, nen after you do, you need to have Angular CLI installed, so now after you do both those, you clone the repo on your pc and install the dependencies and run the code 

the commands in a new file open the cmd and type 

ng version
(if you see angular cli info skip next step)
np install -g @angular/cli 

git clone https://github.com/jawadzd/search
cd search 
npm istall 
ng serve --open 

and this should be it it should run tested and let me know if it is good(yeah yeah the desgin is mid i know)
